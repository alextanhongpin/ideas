## Advices

Norman Ng 1. 96% of businesses fail. This means that statistically only 4% of businesses started have qualified entrepreneurs. While we are all are born equal, opportunities for everyone are not. Think you are qualified? Read on and read Outliers
2. Entrepreneurship is not entirely about taking risks. Entrepreneurship done well is about reducing risks to acceptable levels. 
3. The last generation has taken most of the physical opportunities. That leaves the new generation with the tech space or applying tech to old space. 
4. To start a tech business not very far from making the stars align these days. You need to: Know and sustain your self. Know how to lead. Know how to sell. Know about business. Know about technology. Know whos who. Know about money. 
5. Hackathons mainly focuses on the tech part. Theres so many other areas which are not covered in hackathons.
6. Too many things to summarize here, but successful entrepreneurs have successfully lowered their risks from working years and know their industry, knowing the people in the industry, fail lots of times to learn the hard way, go to business school, have gotten some financial support, have really rich fathers or somehow had their stars align.

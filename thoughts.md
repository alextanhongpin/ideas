## Email sent when preparing for brainstorming for the next architecture

```
Hi all,

I hope you guys prepared some material before we attend the meeting tomorrow. In order to build something that works, we need to know what does not work for us.

Please ask yourself this questions:

- How does the current architecture looks like? Do we have a diagram (visibility) on all our current services?
- Is the current revision of the architecture known to all members? 
- What is the bottleneck of the current architecture?
- What is standard performance of our current architecture (email delivery rate, error rate, match rate)?
- How many times does this architecture fail (where, why)?
- What is the pain point when running this architecture?
- What is out testing standard?
- Is it easy to integrate A/B testing?
- Is it easy to revert changes/fix issues?
- Do we have visibility on failures?
- How do we handle failures?
- What are the technology stacks we are using?
- What technology stack we plan to use?
- What are the bad practices we have in our current architecture/what good practices do we have?
- What features we have and are they delivering the right value (how do we track em)?
- What insights do we get from our system? Is it transparent enough? Does it adds value?

Most important of all, what do we want our next architecture to be able to support?

Please come up with the answers by tomorrow. Prepare any diagrams, architecture suggestion and technology suggestions too.

Regards,

# Things to improve on

## Mindless reading
Reading without a _goal_ can be time consuming. Don’t just read for the sake of reading. I notice most of the time I can hardly remember what I read (poor comprehension), yet I still continue what I am reading. This is particularly a waste of time.
How to do better: 
- instead of rushing to complete the book, try to get the most out of it
- don't immediately start digesting the content, start with the 5W1H first (this can be done when commuting)
- start comparing what you have in mind with the book content


## Commenting on what, not why
Commenting on what is like: assign x to y. The why is like: create a temporary variable x to store y.
How to improve: practice more, and write down more comment. 

## Lack of testing mindset
Still no unit test.
How to improve: write more tests.

## Too dependent on example
Don’t just refer to google for solutions on code. Some things are straightforward and just need more time to get it right. But the lack of critical thinking and creativity is not gonna help you improve.
How to improve: try before referring to solutions online.

## Mindless trial and error in writing code
It takes time to be proficient in writing code. Break down code into small testable units, and have a better understanding in what to achieve.
How to improve: plan before write

## Tracing skills
Tracing skill is particularly important. Knowing the steps that leads to result, and finding out the conditions is something a software developer must know. Also, knowing what is happening in the loop is also important.
How to improve:
- write smaller functions
- think in terms of a single operation in the loop (optimize later, logic first)


## The type of Developer I want to be

I always thought that I need to know everything in the beginning (techical skills, languages etc), but I guess I was wrong. I like DevOps, and I thought by being a DevOps, all I need to know is how to code an application and deploy it to production. I've never been wrong before.

I guess the definition of Developer that I want to be is to simply be someone that enjoys writing code my way :). And what's important is to cultive the appreciation of the code I write. Also, being a DevOps means being able to support the business at operation level, be product-minded and not stick to one goal or definition. Things change, and the ability to adapt, forget old decisions and pivot is essential to be a good developer.

## How to use Github Board

- plan sprint (lock it to milestone)
- create individual features there
- move the cards that needs to be done
- create issues for the features
- assign and execute
- create release once all the features are done


What is a better way to manage both user story for developers and PM?

- identify domains
  - for each domain identify features
    - for each features identify scenario
- PM enter and write a README for each feature
- Start with a use case, e.g. user create job. Then come up with the user story: As an admin, I want to create job, in order to.... Then come up with independent scenarios.
- Test cases should be written to satisfy each scenarios module
- create labels, e.g. domain:question, domain:answer and tag issues to this labels
- additional labels such as feature/enhancements/bug can be added alongside
- ensure that there are assignee, so you know who is working on what
- tag each issues to a milestone too, so that we know when is someone working on sth
- do a month on month tracking for simplicity
- Create cards on project boards, but link them to issue. Once closed, the cards can be archived at the end of the month. The issue stays. Hence it’s best to ensure all the know how is in the issue. After completed, the knowledge should be documented too,
Format
If it’s a fix, before, after, test cases scenarios
If it’s a feature, user story, acceptance criteria, and tasks
If it’s an improvement, benefits of why this 

How to work with boards?
- use it to manage `features`. A feature board may contain all the features required to be built
- use it to manage `incidents`. An incident board may contain all the incidents that happened, and the pull requests associated to fix it. Mark the pull request with the `incident` label.
- 


Things to note:
- a feature is never ending, once it is resolved, plan for the next iteration after gathering enough data.
- for each feature, ensure if fulfils the criteria necessary:
    - modular
    - reusable
    - well-written api and easy to use (swagger)
    - testable, and well tested
    - metrics are provided


Don’t know how to plan your sprint? Use months January February instead
Use versioning for iteration. Every feature will definitely go through a version improvement
Name milestones in the form month,year. 
A milestone must acts as a flow, e.g. planning, development, first quarter, second quarter. At the end of each milestone, documents the thing and archive the card as well as milestone.

Pm Plan feature or bug
Engineer create a feature/hot fix/improvement branch
Engineer work on the tasks there
Pull request is linked to issue, commit should not be linked to issue.
There should be a special issue that tracks the delivery of all sub issues,
We should do it the milestones way, tracking with levels.

E.g. Feature question
What is this feature
Milestone 1:
- Basic crud
Milestone 2:

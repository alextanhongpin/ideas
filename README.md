## Identifying user's personality through conversations

How can we understand the user's personality and tie them to the brigg-myers personality test?

1. From the conversation, check the frequency of the most commonly used words.
2. Check the length of the conversation. Short conversation means more close, longer means more open etc.
3. Check the response time - how fast they reply your message.
4. Check the continuation of the conversation - how many replies they will take before they stop.

## Prevent scraping through pagination token

Numeric pagination is easy to scrape `?limit=9999&offset=1`. Find a way to create a pagination token that is hard to scrape.

Also, do not expose `id` of resources to the frontend. That includes pages that displays a single item and so on e.g. `books/:id`. Rather, use slug instead as identifier.

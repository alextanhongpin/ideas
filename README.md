## Identifying user's personality through conversations

How can we understand the user's personality and tie them to the brigg-myers personality test?

1. From the conversation, check the frequency of the most commonly used words.
2. Check the length of the conversation. Short conversation means more close, longer means more open etc.
3. Check the response time - how fast they reply your message.
4. Check the continuation of the conversation - how many replies they will take before they stop.

## Prevent scraping through pagination token

Numeric pagination is easy to scrape `?limit=9999&offset=1`. Find a way to create a pagination token that is hard to scrape.

Also, do not expose `id` of resources to the frontend. That includes pages that displays a single item and so on e.g. `books/:id`. Rather, use slug instead as identifier.

## Create a simple page for voting

Use websocket that allows clients from different devices to connect and vote.

Ensure that one person can only vote once from the device.

## Reverse Engineer MultiWorld Testing

Start with a simple bandit experiment, understand the limitation (delayed response). Add real-time graphs and intelligent bot to tell you what can be optimized.

## Smart bots with different personality

Create a bot that has different personality (features). Allows users to search through something and create alerts.

## Webhook Server

Design an architecture for a webhook server and integrate it successfully.

## Storing data in IPFS

Look into how to create DAP (decentralized application).

## Clones

Finanz Revamp, Residenz, Instagram clone, Facebook, what is X is Y (what if JobStreet is Facebook?). Point-of-Sale system for food ordering, lorry tracking system. A clone of Journal.

## User Recommendations

Compare the different recommendations approach and look into matrix factorization. 

## Bandit Server

Bandit algorithm application in recommendations and other things. Not the concurrent issue with some algorithms (greedy epsilon) which requires the values to be updated immediately - imagine many users are pulling the same arm at the same time when the algorithm has not been updated.

Also look into how to apply contextual bandit by using decision tree.

## Retry Pattern and Circuit Breaker

Design a retry pattern and circuit breaker that can be reused. It will be using exponential backoff when performing retry.

## Imbalanced Dataset Machine Learning

## CQRS and Event Sourcing

## Sudoku Solver

Look into how to solve sudoku uisng the `Dancing Links` and `Algorithm X` algorithms.

## Relevant Search

Normal search will not do for most cases - try to incorporate context into the search. At the same time, try to add personalization to the search.

Most list pages will display a list of items in the first place. While it's possible to just display them based on the last created date, it doesn't add relevancy to users that has searched for something, and want to search for similar things. So, keep track of what the users have searched for, and then use the last history to compute the personalized search. It would be great to keep another section to recommend users something related to what they have searched for.


## Singleflight pattern

Look into the singleflight pattern for subscribing to connection. http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/cps296.4/fall13/838-CloudPapers/dean_longtail.pdf. Also look into connection pooling in Golang, and sync.Once.

## Future of Web Apps

How would the future of web apps look like? Design conceptual websites with modern technologies.

## ACL Admin

ACL that allows you to limit user's access to certain operation (read, write, etc) and allow you to invite new users through email. Basic implementation with nodejs [here](https://github.com/alextanhongpin/node-scope).


## ABAC and RBAC

Implement Attribute Based Access Control (ACAB) and Role Based Access Control (RCAB) for different languages.

## Chat Server

Create a full chat server. The server is written in [golang](https://github.com/alextanhongpin/go-chat) and the client [Vue](https://github.com/alextanhongpin/vue-chat). Work in progress.

## Bloom Filter

The classic example is using bloom filters to reduce expensive disk (or network) lookups for non-existent keys. Another use case is to check if the unique username existed before allowing users to choose that username.

## Markov Chain Classifier

Predicting user behaviour using transition probability. Can also be used to predict customer conversion (perhaps to find out the churn possibility).

## Spam Filtering

Use naive bayes to predict if a text is spam or not.

## Boosting algorithm

AdaBoost.


## Named Entity Recognition

Learn and understand the use case of NER. Use NER to understand the context of the word - perhaps optimise it so that it can be used to perform more relevant search and deliver a google-like search experience.

Pair it with Grafana and Prometheus.

## Spernerâ€™s Lemma

Algorithm for splitting rent.

## Evolutionary Architecture

I wanted to design an architecture called Perfect Architecture before - only to realize there is no such thing as perfect. It is always `it depends`-architecture and should be designed based on the use cases. But evolutionary architecture is something that I would like to advocate - it mimics the human process and has a brain (machine learning/deep learning) and has a pipeline (whatever organs in the human body has), has self-healing and functions as a whole.

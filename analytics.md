# Analytics

It's good to have dashboard to visualize the output. But rather than visualize, it's better to `verbalize` the output. Let's say we have a goal to increase the CTR, from the data your acquired, you can put them in words:

- We accomplished 20% improvement in CTR over the last `day/week/month/year`.
- We have higher click rates on `mobile` than `desktop`.


## Capturing signals from user.

For example, if you want to know if the user is interested in the price, donâ€™t make is visible. Make user click on the show price to view the price. This is a signal that can be captured.

## Stale data

Understand that data that are logged can be stale if they are not used. Knowing what to do with the data is more important than logging them.

## Data that can be captured

- timestamp
- event name
- caller id
- ip
- region
- latitude/longitude (last ten values, since user moves from one place to another)
- last city
- last login
- last device
- device type (ios, android)
- device name
- screen size
- platform (web, mobile web, mobile native) and also transition between platfroms (night ipad, morning iphone, evening web etc)
- search keywords
- last 10 search (take the last ten instead of historical all value because user preference changes over time)
- pages visited
- links clicked
- duration online
- frequency online
- minute/hour/day/week/month/year online
- current geographical events/celebrations
- referer url
- sequence of actions performed
- what features perform best on what devices
- what is the value of the features (determined by clicks, duration used, lifespan etc)
- click rates

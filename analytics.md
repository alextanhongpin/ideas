# Analytics

It's good to have dashboard to visualize the output. But rather than visualize, it's better to `verbalize` the output. Let's say we have a goal to increase the CTR, from the data your acquired, you can put them in words:

- We accomplished 20% improvement in CTR over the last `day/week/month/year`.
- We have higher click rates on `mobile` than `desktop`.


## Capturing signals from user.

For example, if you want to know if the user is interested in the price, donâ€™t make is visible. Make user click on the show price to view the price. This is a signal that can be captured.

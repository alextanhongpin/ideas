# Rules

Here are some of my personal rules in finance. They are not hard rules - rather they are something that I am experimenting with.

## Save 40% of your income

Keep 40% of your savings in your stash monthly. 

## Eliminate, not reduce

Get rid of things you don't need to spend on - e.g. coffee. There's no point trying to control the budget for things you might not need.

## Invest

Research on investment vehicles (design games that encourage you to do so, or create simulation engine).

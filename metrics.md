## Products release

- measuring the effective of the products matters more than just releasing the products


## Doubts

- FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubts) exists. We will not know if the product is good or bad just by assuming. The only way is to gather metrics on how the product/feature perform through actions performed by users.
- what is the acquisition journey
- what are the mechanism in place that will attract users to use this app
- how do we reward the behaviours of the user and punish them for unsolicited behaviours
- how do we encourage users to engage with our platform? and how about reengagement with the existing users?
- are there historical data that can back the facts/assumptions we have
- without initial assumptions/data, how can we be the first to design them?

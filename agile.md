# Documentation

Decision-driven-development. Most of the time, we depend on requirements to get work done. But requirements are mostly not finalized - we don't know what will happen. And most of the time, there will be changes to the requirement. If the documentation contains only the final outcome, it will be not be good enough to illustrate the issues we face (why we take this decision).

A suggestion is to document the decisions with versioning (most likely date):

- 2017-01-01: v0.0.1 We decide to remove this feature, and add this
- 2017-01-02: v0.0.1 We choose Solr vs Elasticsearch

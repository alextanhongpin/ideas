Hiring in startups 
- Hiring is hard. We know that most people will feel that they are underpaid for their role, but they probably didn’t know that they are overpaid for the role they are holding, or the knowledge that they have. Find a compromise. If you happen to meet someone that are hungry to do more, then hire them straight, and reward them as you grow the company. These kind of people do not usually ask for more than they can get, and at the same time they will help you grow the company.
- You are a startup, resources are scarce. Don’t hire people that are going after your money - they are the bystanders, they will leave you in times of trouble. And remember, in startup those times are more frequent than you can ever imagine, and could be a tipping point between success or failures. You need champions that can help you tilt the scales and bring you toward the goal you have always wanted - to build a sustainable business that can provide values to people.
- Hire people champions, not gifted individual. In order for the company to grow, we want people that inspire, not order. We need people that can pass the baton to the next generation, not hold the know-how and leave the company to start their own. In startups, people come and go, and sometimes at an alarming rate. You can’t take for granted that the person sitting next to you will still be there the next day. What you can do is to have mutual respect for them, guide them, teach them while they are still there, and inspire them to share and grow themselves and others around them.
